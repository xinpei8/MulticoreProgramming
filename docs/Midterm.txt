1. 
   a. Rewrite the bitset class to make reset(), flip() methods thread-safe.
   b. Rewrite test() methods to make it thread-safe
   c. Propose a way in terms of locking to make it more parallel
   d. What if we say it is only 86x or 86x64, any difference?
   e. What if we say instead of 1 byte for one element in each array index, we record 8 elements in 1 byte in each array index?

2. 

3. What is coroutine and what’s the difference between coroutines and threads? May give a pseudo code for example. If you don’t know the answer, explain … instead.

   a. Instruction-level parallelism
   b. Basic block-level parallelism
   c. Task-level parallelism

5. What is CAS (compare and swap)?
  a. explain the return value and parameters of CAS()
  b. use CAS() to modify below method to make it thread-safe

     int getSum(int a){
	return sum_a + a;
     }
