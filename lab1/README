There are five files for lab1:
1. Definition and implementation of the thread-safe objects: ThreadSafeKVStore.h ThreadSafeListenerQueue.h
2. Helper class for thread-safe std output: ThreadSafeCout 
3. Code for testing: main.cpp
4. Makefile

Write command "make" in terminal under the file directory /lab1 and run the test with arguments of N (number of threads):
