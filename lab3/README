README

Please refer to the report in Lab3_Statistics_Report.pdf

To run the server program, write command "make" in terminal under the file directory /lab3 and run the server with arguments of N (number of threads) and P (port number):
> make
> ./test -n <N> <P> 
> ./test -n 50 2020

When testing with client tools(httperf), assign localhost and port number for testing.


Note:
I solved the issue of not being able to know whether to close the connection after reading all the requests with a workaround solution. This idea comes from the discussion with I-Wu Lu. We found that after reading all the requests in one connection, the readline() will keep getting ‘\0’. So I make the parser to detect this fact and close the connection once we found this fact. The solution can be found with the modification in the method of readLine() in HTTPReq.cc.
